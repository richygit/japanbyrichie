      <description>Visit the Otani Website  yourself to see what&amp;rsquo;s happening.
There&amp;rsquo;s more than meets the eye when it comes to the Otani art museum. It was meant to be the day typhoon Halim arrived. However as it turned out, the typhoon arrived the night before and it was (fortunately) nothing more than a fizzer. Where I was, the rain barely registered, there was some wind during the night but by the time morning broke it was already sunny again.</description>
