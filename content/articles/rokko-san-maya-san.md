I mostly followed [https://japanhike.wordpress.com/2010/01/06/rokku-gaaden/](this guy's) really good guide to start from the 'Rock Garden' near Ashiyagawa Station. If I had follow his helpful pictures in addition to his written guide it would have saved me some time. Also, I probably shouldn't have done this in the height of summer, but with the spirit of adventure I set out for a much longer walk that I intended and brought an woefully inadequate amount of water. 

> In all, I walked about 25km and drank about 6L of water.

It wasn't the greatest idea at the time to trek two mountains in the same day in 30+ degree heat. Fortunately, Mt Rokko is more like a tourist park than nature centre so there was more than ample opportunities to rehydrate and eat.

It all started with a walk through a cool canopy covered road to a shack that marks the start of the walk. From there I scrambled up the rocks of the rock garden taking in the view. It was a fairly steep ascent but it doesn't last too long.

Then the walk to the top of Mt Rokko begins. There's plenty of views to take in along the way. It was a hot day though so I wanted to keep moving. The path wends its way through forest, along creeks and reveals glimpses of Kobe as you walk up. The peak itself isn't all that interesting - it's got a nice view but kind of just in a clearing and not so pretty. By this stage, it was still only morning (I had set out from my house around 9am I think) so I decided to push on and see how far I could get.

What I discovered was that Mt Rokko is a tourist wonderland. There's observation decks, cafes, restaurants, tourist lounges, paid entry gardens and much more at the top. Spread throughout the park there's also what looked like a zoo, signs for an adventure park, some kind of music museum and last but not least the famous Arima Onsen. I actually wanted to stop at Arima Onsen but instead of sitting in a hot bath during a hot day I decided to push on instead and come for a visit another time.

Until this part, the path had been relatively easy to follow. Just follow the kanji for 'Rokko', 'mountain', 'utmost top', however when I reached the tourist park I lost the signs once again (I also had to ask for help when I got to the top of Mt Rokko). I wasn't too keen to head back down yet and I wanted to see if I could reach Mt Mayu along the ridge of the mountains. I was hoping it wouldn't be too difficult either because I was tiring from not having walked for a long time and the heat. I figured it would be mostly a descent since Mt Rokko was the tallest mountain, right?
