It's pretty damn exciting for me to visit an ethnology museum. I think my first encounter with an ethnology was actually in Bangladesh. If I recall correctly, I learned not only about the people who were indigenous to the land but the thing that sticks with me was the jewellery - really incredible pieces of art that showcased incredible craftsmanship, nothing less.

So I was pretty excited to finally see the collection after several ventures out to Bampaku Park for fireflies, a world music festival and even a flower festival. I only had a little time there so it was a quick visit to see what was there. The main drawcard for me of course would be the specialty information they would be able to provide on this part of the world, especially the indigenous populations like the Ainu.

I kinda spent too much time looking through the museum however as I got caught up in the sections for all the other places in the world, from how people spread through the Pacific, how Asian languages evolved and are related, and what seafaring was like back without modern technology. Before I knew it an hour had already passed and I was still in Asia and the Pacific!

So I made tracks for the section on Japan, browsing through the other continents and regions. Along the way I discovered Indonesian batik actually may have been introduced from Africa. I was also lucky enough to see the cloth which covered the Ka'bah in Mecca. This cloth had been donated and was currently on display in the museum and to see the incredibly detailed embroidery all over was really unbelievable.

But it was in the Japan section that I spent the rest of my time. The indigenous peoples of this area had their own way of living and culture, and there's an ongoing battle to try and preserve that history and culture. From what I gathered, the Ainu now live mostly in the Northern Islands of Japan. They have their own language, customs and religion and are very distinctive from the Japanese people we know now. It was refreshing to see an entire section devoted to the history of the people prior to the Japanese people we know today.

I also had a bit of time to poke around the remaining Japanese section, seeing that festivals and customs make up a big part of what Japan has. It's also interesting to note that a lot of the history of Japan has been about preservation - the reason why so many festivals have such a long tradition is because a strong emphasis has been placed on continuing things unchanged, even from a long time ago.

Eventually, I had to go because the place was closing but it was not without promising myself I would visit again and spend probably half a day there to actually take more of it in.
