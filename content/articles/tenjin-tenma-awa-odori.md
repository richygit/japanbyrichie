Awa Odori is the dance that Tokushima prefecture in Shikoku is especially known for. Shikoku is the smallest of the small islands to the South West of the main island - Honshu. It is here that you can see the real Awa Odori festival - one that attracts over a million visitors every year.

Unfortunately I had other plans for this year's Obon period so instead I caught the festivities at Tenjinbashi in North-East Osaka. It really was heaps of fun and I can see why so many people flock to Tokushima each year. With the movement, the people and crowds bringing the excitement, the drums and music tearing through you, the whistles screaming, people shouting along with the music and the colour pastel colours and splendid yukata and makeup - it's really hard not to get caught up in all of it.

Looking back on these photos I realised the photo taking took a back seat to just soaking up the experience. We even ended up at temple where it starts and ends and just caught the end of the last dance where people get to participate. Here's a short snippet of part of the video, unfortunately the dude in front of me has his fan going the whole time which makes the video really annoying. But still, well worth the day and I'd really love to go back and see what else I missed on the day.
