Gion Matsuri is known as one of the big three festivals of Kyoto. The festivities actually extend for the entire month and it culminates in a couple parades that go right through the heart of the city and around the historic centre.

It's really feasible to attend all the festivities, and you probably don't really want to unless you're a hardcore religious and culture nut. But as it turns out, the largest of the parades fell on a day I could attend. 

Most people I talked to weren't interested in going, preferring to watch it on TV or just didn't care much for it at all. As a foreigner, it's surprising because it's such a historic and well known festival.

**The history**

This festival started well over 1000 years ago, as a way to please the gods and to cleanse and purify the place after having suffered severe hardships. In the intervening years, emperors have tried to stop the festival but the tradition has lived on. Nowadays it still maintains a lot of its historical significance as a tradition that has survived and been reborn through the centuries.

There are two types of floats, the larger Hoko floats and the smaller Yama floats. Each has a history and a represents a different aspect of the festival. The order of the floats changes each year, however the first float is always the same. It carries a young boy who is sort of a scared representative. He apparently goes through a month long ritual of purification during which amongst other things, he's not allowed to touch the ground. In the photo below you can just make out the kid, completely expressionless he looked like a statue and he rarely moved throughout the entire time we watched him.

The Hoko floats of course were enormous. They are covered with intricate tapestries and have delicate carvings. The top of the floats have a spire that extends the height of them further to the heavens. However this is necessarily a good thing. There's a guy in charge of lowering the spire when the float goes past an electricity line, so of course nobody dies and crucial infrastructure isn't destroyed every year.

{{< fig caption="The float is so big it often extends above many building, although Kyoto's skyline isn't so high either." alt="The spire of the float extends skywards making it look like a giant radio tower." src="articles/gion-matsuri/tall-float.jpg" >}}

However, I soon discovered why people weren't so interested in seeing the event. Firstly, the crowds were huge - it was difficult walking around let alone getting close enough to see any of the action in detail. Secondly, there were a crap ton of floats and they were all moving at walking speed. In fact, they're moving even slower because these huge precarious things have to stop in order for the people who have formed huge lines with ropes that extend a hundred metres before the float, then have to reposition themselves all over again in order to turn the thing. The whole thing is an ordeal, and although there (fortunately) aren't many turns, it does slow it all down. We lasted about 3 floats I think before we decided to call it quits.

That's not to say it wasn't worth seeing. I knew all this before heading out there, but it's something that you should see once given how important it is in the festival calendar. If I were to do it again, I'd probably come a lot earlier, bring a chair and take a different vantage point (beg one of the tenants of the buildings that line the parade to let me be one of those people that hangs out the window). Or better still, be one of those guys in the floats just hanging out while hundreds of people pull you around Kyoto.
