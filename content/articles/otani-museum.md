There's more than meets the eye when it comes to the Otani art museum. It was meant to be the day typhoon Halim arrived. However as it turned out, the typhoon arrived the night before and it was (fortunately) nothing more than a fizzer. Where I was, the rain barely registered, there was some wind during the night but by the time morning broke it was already sunny again.

So I set out that day to visit the museum. There was an exhibition of art from children's book illustrators. It was really special to be able to experience something like that, given that exhibitions like probably would never make it to Sydney let alone Australia.

But the icing on the cake was the museum itself.
