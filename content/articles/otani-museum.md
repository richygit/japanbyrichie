Illustrators and artists from all over the world converge on [Bologna]( http://www.bookfair.bolognafiere.it/en/home/878.html ) each year to showcase their wares in the hopes of being recognised or published. A collection of works from this Expo goes on tour, and this year it came to Japan.

It was pretty amazing to see the incredibly inspiring and creative artworks on show, a lot of them probably not suitable to children audiences. Unfortunately you weren't allowed to take photos so I don't have much to show for it. What was really interesting to think about was: here's this industry where you try to eek out a living by being creative and creating original work. Then there's these peripheral industries where you make money by doing 'creative' work like designing, advertising, etc. And this is really one of those industries, except it's within an industry where it's also creative. I wondered how much of this was driven by the writer, how much was a collaboration and whether this was different in the children's book industry compared to the adult book industry.

The other major drawcard for the visit was [ Otani Museum ]( http://otanimuseum.jp/english.html ) itself. It's just outside of Kobe city and kinda in the sticks but has an incredible garden to complement the gallery space inside. Within the gardens that surround the museum building are a number of sculptures scattered throughout the place. On this day it must have been exactly as the benefactors envisioned - a bright sunny day, people packed into the museum, children running around in the garden spaces, couples taking a stroll through the sunlit paths, and of course me taking photos.

This visit very nearly didn't happen, as everyone the week before was worried about the typhoon that was approaching. The predictions are really amazing when it comes to predicting the path of a typhoon. However the timing was rather strange. It was all meant to hit when I was at Kishiwada Danjiri Matsuri the day before, however that afternoon nothing really happened. I waited all night and it wasn't until several hours until after it was due to arrive that the rains and winds came. But pretty soon it was all over it was barely more than a storm by then. The next morning it was blue sky and most of Osaka was very lucky to have come through unscathed.

I was really happy to not only come so close to a typhoon and coming out in one piece, but also get to visit the garden in all its glory the next day.

Maybe they'd already seen it." alt="Beautiful winding pathway with prefectly shaped trees lining the path and emerald colours gouncing off the plants." src="articles/otani-museum/picturesque-pathway.jpg" >}}

Definitely worth another visit, maybe in the Autumn when there's another interesting exhibition on.
