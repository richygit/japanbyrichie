{{< lede "Putting bodies, houses and wooden floats on the line this festival features the spectacle of throngs of people pulling massive floats through the narrow streets of the city. TLDR: Jump to the end to watch the video." >}}

I learned long ago not to ask why at matsuri (festivals). Why do they hold this festival? Why do they pull the Danjiri (floats) around? Why is there a man standing on the top dancing? Most of the time, nobody knows. Sometimes you'll get to ask a local and they'll invariably give you a wholly unsatisfying answer. "It's been held for more than 70 years!" Or: "My father, grandfather and his father participated in this."

So why, in country known for people wearing face masks to prevent the spread of disease, do hundreds of people volunteer to risk their lives pulling a wooden Danjiri weighing several tonnes through the narrow streets of a town in Southern Osaka?

One Danjiri takes hundreds of people, to pull it across, and there's a route they take on the way to the local shrine through the town. Of course, they don't just pull it at walking pace, but they have to sprint and break neck speed, all the while there's shouting, screaming, instruments and chanting. And the time they pull it the fastest is when they round a corner. Which kinda makes sense when you think about it - it takes a lot of energy to change direction. But also it doesn't make sense when you think about how narrow the streets are, how spectators are so close and how the 2-3 storey high Danjiri weighs many tonnes.

> You mean people have died at this festival??

> Yeah, I've heard it's happened a few times

The dangers are numerous. The first is to the guys in and on the danjiri and it's quite obvious. The second is to the people who are pulling the things, at full tilt - there's a clear danger of getting trampled or even run over. You can see that the kids have been trained to hold on to the rope tightly and not to let go! Finally, there's the danger to spectators and the surrounds. The map we were given highlighted a red area that was the danger zone at the corners of intersections.

The most interesting part of the route the locals told us was one little chicane through a narrow street.

You can tell it's not that safe because there's streaming tape like a crime scene and tarps strewn across the parts that have either been damaged or will be damaged soon as a giant wooden float tears past and crashes into your house. Or simply because that section that you own has recently been replaced.

What captured me the most was the incredible display of the man at the top, dancing and flapping with fans in each hand. It was truly captivating to watch this person straddle the danjiri at such a height, hopping from one side to the other as he look like he was harnessing the wind. There was majesty in the expression of energy as he almost willed the gods to propel the danjiri at lightning speed, without a singular care for his own safety as he channelled the movement and sound just like a bird embellishing its nest with movement and magnificence.
