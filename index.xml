      <description>Putting bodies, houses and wooden floats on the line this festival features the spectacle of throngs of people pulling massive floats through the narrow streets of the city. TLDR: Jump to the end to watch the video. I learned long ago not to ask why at matsuri (fetivals). Why do they hold this festival? Why do they pull the Danjiri (floats) around? Why is there a man standing on the top dancing?</description>

      <description>Every time I learned something new about Japan I grew more intrigued.
 When I first came to Japan in 2014 it was an interesting time in my life. In coming here I got some answers but my questions multiplied. Sure, like a lot of things I probably had an idealised view of what this place was like, but it was just fascinating from every angle. Now, I&amp;rsquo;m here.</description>

      <description>Thsi is no 1 Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&amp;rsquo;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</description>
