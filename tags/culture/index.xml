      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s pretty damn exciting for me to visit an ethnology museum. I think my first encounter with an ethnology was actually in Bangladesh. If I recall correctly, I learned not only about the people who were indigenous to the land but the thing that sticks with me was the jewellery - really incredible pieces of art that showcased incredible craftsmanship, nothing less.
So I was pretty excited to finally see the collection after several ventures out to Bampaku Park for fireflies, a world music festival and even a flower festival.</description>
