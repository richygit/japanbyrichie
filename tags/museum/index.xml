      <description>Illustrators and artists from all over the world converge on Bologna each year to showcase their wares in the hopes of being recognised or published. A collection of works from this Expo goes on tour, and this year it came to Japan.
It was pretty amazing to see the incredibly inspiring and creative artworks on show, a lot of them probably not suitable to children audiences. Unfortunately you weren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to take photos so I don&amp;rsquo;t have much to show for it.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s pretty damn exciting for me to visit an ethnology museum. I think my first encounter with an ethnology was actually in Bangladesh. If I recall correctly, I learned not only about the people who were indigenous to the land but the thing that sticks with me was the jewellery - really incredible pieces of art that showcased incredible craftsmanship, nothing less.
So I was pretty excited to finally see the collection after several ventures out to Bampaku Park for fireflies, a world music festival and even a flower festival.</description>
