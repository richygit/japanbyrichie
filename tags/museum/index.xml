      <description>Illustrators and artists from all over the world converge on Bologna each year to showcase their wares in the hopes of being recognised or published. A collection of works from this Expo goes on tour, and this year it came to Japan.
It was pretty amazing to see the incredibly inspiring and creative artworks on show, a lot of them probably not suitable to children audiences. Unfortunately you weren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to take photos so I don&amp;rsquo;t have much to show for it.</description>
