      <description>Putting bodies, houses and wooden floats on the line this festival features the spectacle of throngs of people pulling massive floats through the narrow streets of the city. TLDR: Jump to the end to watch the video. I learned long ago not to ask why at matsuri (festivals). Why do they hold this festival? Why do they pull the Danjiri (floats) around? Why is there a man standing on the top dancing?</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s pretty damn exciting for me to visit an ethnology museum. I think my first encounter with an ethnology was actually in Bangladesh. If I recall correctly, I learned not only about the people who were indigenous to the land but the thing that sticks with me was the jewellery - really incredible pieces of art that showcased incredible craftsmanship, nothing less.
So I was pretty excited to finally see the collection after several ventures out to Bampaku Park for fireflies, a world music festival and even a flower festival.</description>

      <title>Tenjin Tenma Awa Odori Matsuri</title>

      <description>Awa Odori is the dance that Tokushima prefecture in Shikoku is especially known for. Shikoku is the smallest of the small islands to the South West of the main island - Honshu. It is here that you can see the real Awa Odori festival - one that attracts over a million visitors every year.
Unfortunately I had other plans for this year&amp;rsquo;s Obon period so instead I caught the festivities at Tenjinbashi in North-East Osaka.</description>
