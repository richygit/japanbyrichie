      <description>I mostly followed this guy&amp;rsquo;s  really good guide to start from the &amp;lsquo;Rock Garden&amp;rsquo; near Ashiyagawa Station. If I had follow his helpful pictures in addition to his written guide it would have saved me some time. Also, I probably shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have done this in the height of summer, but with the spirit of adventure I set out for a much longer walk that I intended and brought an woefully inadequate amount of water.</description>
