      <description>Gion Matsuri is known as one of the big three festivals of Kyoto. The festivities actually extend for the entire month and it culminates in a couple parades that go right through the heart of the city and around the historic centre.
 There were heaps of people who turned out for this enormous parade  It&amp;rsquo;s really feasible to attend all the festivities, and you probably don&amp;rsquo;t really want to unless you&amp;rsquo;re a hardcore religious and culture nut.</description>
