      <description>Illustrators and artists from all over the world converge on Bologna each year to showcase their wares in the hopes of being recognised or published. A collection of works from this Expo goes on tour, and this year it came to Japan.
It was pretty amazing to see the incredibly inspiring and creative artworks on show, a lot of them probably not suitable to children audiences. Unfortunately you weren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to take photos so I don&amp;rsquo;t have much to show for it.</description>

      <description>I mostly followed https://japanhike.wordpress.com/2010/01/06/rokku-gaaden/ really good guide to start from the &amp;lsquo;Rock Garden&amp;rsquo; near Ashiyagawa Station. If I had follow his helpful pictures in addition to his written guide it would have saved me some time. Also, I probably shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have done this in the height of summer, but with the spirit of adventure I set out for a much longer walk that I intended and brought an woefully inadequate amount of water.</description>
