      <description>Putting bodies, houses and wooden floats on the line this festival features the spectacle of throngs of people pulling massive floats through the narrow streets of the city. TLDR: Jump to the end to watch the video. I learned long ago not to ask why at matsuri (festivals). Why do they hold this festival? Why do they pull the Danjiri (floats) around? Why is there a man standing on the top dancing?</description>

      <description>Visit the Otani Website  yourself to see what&amp;rsquo;s happening.
There&amp;rsquo;s more than meets the eye when it comes to the Otani art museum. It was meant to be the day typhoon Halim arrived. However as it turned out, the typhoon arrived the night before and it was (fortunately) nothing more than a fizzer. Where I was, the rain barely registered, there was some wind during the night but by the time morning broke it was already sunny again.</description>
