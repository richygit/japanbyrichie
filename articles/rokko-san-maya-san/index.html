              <p>I mostly followed <a href="https://japanhike.wordpress.com/2010/01/06/rokku-gaaden/"> this guy&rsquo;s </a> really good guide to start from the &lsquo;Rock Garden&rsquo; near Ashiyagawa Station. If I had follow his helpful pictures in addition to his written guide it would have saved me some time. Also, I probably shouldn&rsquo;t have done this in the height of summer, but with the spirit of adventure I set out for a much longer walk that I intended and brought an woefully inadequate amount of water.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In all, I walked about 25km and drank about 6L of water.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t the greatest idea at the time to trek two mountains in the same day in 35°C+ heat. Fortunately, Mt Rokko is more like a tourist park than nature centre so there was more than ample opportunities to rehydrate and eat.</p>

<p>It all started with a walk through a cool canopy covered road to a shack that marks the start of the walk. From there I scrambled up the rocks of the rock garden taking in the view. It was a fairly steep ascent but it doesn&rsquo;t last too long.</p>

  <img alt="Large stones on the path through the forest" src="/images/articles/rokko-maya/stones-0c747010.jpg"  srcset="/images/articles/rokko-maya/stones-450px-c0b2f3fe.jpg 450w, /images/articles/rokko-maya/stones-768px-9c126aa5.jpg 768w, /images/articles/rokko-maya/stones-1024px-5e931d7e.jpg 1024w, /images/articles/rokko-maya/stones-0c747010.jpg" />
  <figcaption>The walk through the rock garden leads to a stony path that&#39;s often uneven</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Then the walk to the top of Mt Rokko begins. There&rsquo;s plenty of views to take in along the way. It was a hot day though so I wanted to keep moving. The path wends its way through forest, along creeks and reveals glimpses of Kobe as you walk up. The peak itself isn&rsquo;t all that interesting - it&rsquo;s got a nice view but kind of just in a clearing and not so pretty. By this stage, it was still only morning (I had set out from my house around 9am I think) so I decided to push on and see how far I could get.</p>

<p>What I discovered was that Mt Rokko is a tourist wonderland. There&rsquo;s observation decks, cafes, restaurants, tourist lounges, paid entry gardens and much more at the top. Spread throughout the park there&rsquo;s also what looked like a zoo, signs for an adventure park, some kind of music museum and last but not least the famous Arima Onsen. I actually wanted to stop at Arima Onsen but instead of sitting in a hot bath during a hot day I decided to push on instead and come for a visit another time.</p>

<p>Until this part, the path had been relatively easy to follow. Just follow the kanji for &lsquo;Rokko&rsquo;, &lsquo;mountain&rsquo;, &lsquo;utmost&rsquo; (top), however when I reached the tourist park I lost the signs once again. I had actually lost the trail just before I hit the summit of Mt Rokko because the signs were not very clear. There&rsquo;s a little way station near the top where you can get a drink or shaved ice and a road but not many signs indicating how to get to the summit. You&rsquo;ve got to cross the road and follow the concrete path up to the underwhelming clearing at the top and the obstructed views. On the path the top is a little resting point and a small pergola, and this is where the trail picks up back down and towards the tourist area.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t too keen to head back down yet and I wanted to see if I could reach Mt Mayu along the ridge of the mountains. I was hoping it wouldn&rsquo;t be too difficult either because I was tiring from not having walked for a long time and the heat. I figured it would be mostly a descent since Mt Rokko was the tallest mountain, right?</p>

<p>So I asked a guy at a car park for directions and he didn&rsquo;t know where the train picked up again, but instead pointed me to a shortcut that went to the music box museum.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this only lead back to the main road which I had no choice but to follow down. When I finally got to the saddle between Mt Rokko and Mt Maya, I discovered that there was indeed a trail, one that was not only more scenic but was actually shorter and would have saved me time too. But it wasn&rsquo;t the end of the world because I came across the breathtaking Tenjō-ji Temple.</p>

<p>There entranceway itself is a beautiful thing which greets you with lush green trees and highlighted by an incredible, aged flowering tree that guards the pathway. As I ascended, it was just so peaceful and serene it was as though entering Tenjō-ji Temple was like being transported to another time. The garden and temple complex at the top of the stairs was just perfection and the unforgiving sky was a perfect frame for such a radiant temple.</p>

<p>When I finally reached Mt Maya it was worth it. I was in dear need of more water and also pretty hungry so I was glad to see there was a cafe with a gorgeous view of Kobe from the top. I had a delicious beef curry there and took some time to cool down and ask for directions. By now the sun was starting to get pretty low and the staff were really helpful in pointing me in the right direction as I wanted to push on to Nunobiki Garden and Nunobiki falls. I had fantasised that I would be able to have a quick dip in the waterfall, thinking of the time I went hiking in the Blue Mountains and found a beautiful waterfall right when I wanted it the most.</p>

<p>I wanted to hike however the constant warnings of <em>inoshishi</em> (wild boar) and the failing sunlight between the trees was not making me feel good. As I hit Nunobiki Herb Garden the canopy was filtering so much of the setting sunlight that I decided I should leave the trail when I nearly walked straight into a huge spider web that was like a gate through the entire trail and was almost as tall as me!</p>

<p>I hastily trekked towards the reservoir which was a welcome, calming relief with the vast expanse of water. By now I just wanted to zoom back to civilisation and I didn&rsquo;t want to get caught out in the dark, not knowing what the path ahead was like.</p>






<figure>
  <img alt="Water reservoir looks like a lake surrounded by tranquil trees and gentle peaks." src="/images/articles/rokko-maya/reservoir-539e04a0.jpg"  srcset="/images/articles/rokko-maya/reservoir-450px-8e75a5af.jpg 450w, /images/articles/rokko-maya/reservoir-768px-d348efab.jpg 768w, /images/articles/rokko-maya/reservoir-1024px-dbd243b8.jpg 1024w, /images/articles/rokko-maya/reservoir-539e04a0.jpg" />
  <figcaption>The reservoir is still used for drinking water for Kobe and quite a few locals were walking in the opposite direction for a bit of evening exercise.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>I also came across a local tourist attraction - the vine bridge which joined two banks of the river beneath the reservoir. It was a sweet looking bridge but the light was low so I didn&rsquo;t linger too long.</p>

<p>I finally arrived at Nunobiki and to my relief it wasn&rsquo;t too dark to get some photos and it was also very close to the station. I had been walking pretty much since the morning and it would soon be 6 PM by the time I got to the subway to get the train back home. I spent some time at the falls to just reflect on what a day it had been, soaking in the sounds of the rushing water, flowing breeze and welcome respite from the heat.</p>

  <figcaption>The vine bridge didn&#39;t look like it needed the vines at all but I&#39;m guessing it was all vines before the concrete path was put in.</figcaption>

<p>It was quite the adventure! I&rsquo;d love to do it again, especially taking in Mt Maya as it has a wonderful panorama of Kobe which would be really spectacular in the evenings. I got home relatively early and was able to soak in the bath after a long weary day, but ironically rejuvenated and feeling so much better after not having gone for a hike all summer.</p>
